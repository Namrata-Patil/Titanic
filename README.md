# Titanic Disaster

You can visit [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to learn more about the dataset.

Goal : Predict if a passenger survived or not.

Two files have been provided:
1. train.csv
2. test.csv

The training set is used to build your machine learning models. 

The test set is used to see how well our model performs on unseen data. For each passenger in the test set, we used the model we trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

There is also a file called gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.
